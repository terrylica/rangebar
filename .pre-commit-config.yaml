# Pre-commit hooks configuration for rangebar
# Install: pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install
#
# IMPORTANT: This does NOT run cargo clean!
# - cargo clean deletes build artifacts (40GB+)
# - Running it on every commit would require full rebuilds (5-15 min each)
# - Build artifacts are cleaned by scheduled task instead
#   See: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.cleanup-dev.plist (runs daily at 2 AM)
#
# Purpose: Prevent large files from being committed to git version control
