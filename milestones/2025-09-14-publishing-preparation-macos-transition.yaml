summary: Publishing preparation completion with macOS transition after 1Password CLI cleanup

lessons_learned:
  challenges:
    - description: 1Password CLI terminal compatibility issues on remote Linux environment
      impact: Blocked automated publishing workflow with "inappropriate ioctl for device" errors

    - description: Cross-platform credential management complexity
      impact: Required platform-specific authentication solutions instead of unified approach

    - description: Environment-specific toolchain dependencies
      impact: Publishing workflow needed to be redesigned for different platforms

  failed_approaches:
    - approach: 1Password CLI integration for automated credential management
      reason_failed: Terminal compatibility issues on remote Linux - "inappropriate ioctl for device"
      lesson: Some credential management tools require interactive terminal sessions incompatible with remote environments

    - approach: Universal cross-platform publishing automation
      reason_failed: Platform-specific authentication and security tool limitations
      lesson: Publishing workflows may need platform-specific implementations rather than universal solutions

  successful_solution:
    approach: Clean separation of publishing preparation from credential management
    key_insights:
      - Preserve all package preparation work (metadata, CI/CD, documentation)
      - Remove platform-incompatible credential management components
      - Enable user to complete publishing from their preferred platform (macOS)
      - Maintain clean repository state for future development

  patterns_identified:
    - pattern: Publishing preparation vs. execution separation
      context: When credential management has platform constraints, separate preparation from execution

    - pattern: Platform fallback strategy
      context: When automation fails on one platform, preserve work and enable manual completion on compatible platform

    - pattern: Clean environment transition
      context: Remove all traces of failed integration to prevent confusion and provide clear starting point

  future_guidance:
    - Test credential management tools on target deployment platform before integration
    - Consider platform-specific publishing workflows rather than universal automation
    - Preserve publishing preparation work independently of credential management approach
    - Document platform-specific requirements and limitations early in development process
    - When automation fails, prioritize clean fallback to manual processes over forced fixes

technical_details:
  architecture_changes:
    - Removed 1Password CLI integration completely
    - Preserved GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
    - Maintained Rust Edition 2024 upgrade and crates.io metadata
    - Cleaned .claude/tools/ and .claude/docs/ directories of 1Password scripts

  new_dependencies:
    - GitHub Actions workflows for CI and release automation
    - Updated Cargo.toml with complete package metadata

  performance_impacts: None - cleanup operation only

  security_considerations:
    - Removed credential management automation that was failing
    - User retains control over credential management on their platform
    - Publishing security now relies on platform-native authentication

publishing_preparation_preserved:
  - rust_edition: "2024"
  - crates_metadata: Complete with keywords, categories, description, license
  - ci_cd_workflows: GitHub Actions for testing and release automation
  - documentation: README-crates.md for package documentation
  - code_quality: Updated benchmarks, statistics, and type definitions

transition_state:
  - environment_cleaned: true
  - publishing_ready: true
  - platform_target: macOS with native credential management
  - user_action_required: Complete publishing from macOS environment

milestone_significance: |
  This milestone represents the successful completion of package preparation
  and transition to a clean, platform-appropriate publishing workflow. The failure of
  1Password CLI integration led to valuable insights about cross-platform automation
  limitations and the importance of separating publishing preparation from credential
  management execution. All technical preparation work for package distribution has been
  preserved and is ready for use.
